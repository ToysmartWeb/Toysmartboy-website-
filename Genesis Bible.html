				<h1>GENESIS verse 1 to end</h1>
				<p class="chapters">Genesis 1</p>
				<ol class="list">
					<li class="vs">In the abeginning, God created the heavens and the earth.</li>
					<li class="vs">The earth was bwithout form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.</li>
					<li class="vs">And God said, c“Let there be light,” and there was light. </li>
					<li class="vs"> And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness.</li>
					<li class="vs">God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.</li>
					<li class="vs">And God said, d“Let there be an expanse1 in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”</li>
					<li class="vs">And God made2 the expanse and eseparated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were fabove the expanse. And it was so.</li>
					<li class="vs">And God called the expanse Heaven.3 And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.</li>
					<li class="vs">And God said, g“Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so.</li>
					<li class="vs">God called the dry land Earth,4 and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.</li>
					<li class="vs">And God said, h“Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants5 yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, on the earth.” And it was so. </li>
					<li class="vs">The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. </li>
					<li class="vs">And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.</li>
					<li class="vs">And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night. And let them be for isigns and for jseasons,6 and for days and years,</li>
					<li class="vs">And let them be lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth.” And it was so. </li>
					<li class="vs">And God kmade the two great lights—the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night—and the stars.</li>
					<li class="vs">And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, </li>
					<li class="vs">to lrule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good. </li>
					<li class="vs">And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.</li>
					<li class="vs">And God said, “Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds7 fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens.” </li>
					<li class="vs">So mGod created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. </li>
					<li class="vs">And God blessed them, saying, n“Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”</li>
					<li class="vs">And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.</li>
					<li class="vs">And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds—livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so. </li>
					<li class="vs">And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</li>
					<li class="vs">Then God said, o“Let us make man8 in our image, pafter our likeness. And qlet them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”</li>
					<li class="vs">So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; rmale and female he created them.</li>
					<li class="vs">And God blessed them. And God said to them, s“Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”</li>
					<li class="vs">And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. tYou shall have them for food. </li>
					<li class="vs">And uto every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. </li>
					<li class="vs">And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</li>
					
					
					<p class="chapters">Genesis 2</p>
				<ol class="list">
					<li class="vs">Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</li>
					<li class="vs">And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made</li>
					<li class="vs">And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</li>
					<li class="vs">These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,</li>
					<li class="vs">And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.</li>
					<li class="vs">But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</li>
					<li class="vs">And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</li>
					<li class="vs">nd the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</li>
					<li class="vs">And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</li>
					<li class="vs">And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</li>
					<li class="vs">The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</li>
					<li class="vs">And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</li>
					<li class="vs">And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</li>
					<li class="vs">And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</li>
					<li class="vs">And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</li>
					<li class="vs">And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</li>
					<li class="vs">But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</li>
					<li class="vs">And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</li>
					<li class="vs">And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</li>
					<li class="vs">And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</li>
					<li class="vs">And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</li>
					<li class="vs">And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</li>
					<li class="vs">And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</li>
					<li class="vs">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</li>
					<li class="vs">And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</li>
					
					</ol>
					
					<p class="chapters">Genesis 3</p>
					<ol class="list">
						<li class="vs">Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</li>
						<li class="vs">And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:</li>
						<li class="vs">But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</li>
						<li class="vs">And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</li>
						<li class="vs">For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</li>
						<li class="vs">And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</li>
						<li class="vs">And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</li>
						<li class="vs">And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</li>
						<li class="vs">And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?</li>
						<li class="vs">And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</li>
						<li class="vs">And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</li>
						<li class="vs">And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</li>
						<li class="vs">And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</li>
						<li class="vs">And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</li>
						<li class="vs">And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</li>
						<li class="vs">Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</li>
						<li class="vs">And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;</li>
						<li class="vs">Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</li>
						<li class="vs">In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</li>
						<li class="vs">And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</li>
						<li class="vs">Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</li>
						<li class="vs">And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:</li>
						<li class="vs">Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</li>
						<li class="vs">So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</li>

							<li class="vs">And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</li>
							<li class="vs">And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</li>
							<li class="vs">And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</li>
							<li class="vs">But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</li>
							<li class="vs">And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</li>
							<li class="vs">If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</li>
							<li class="vs">And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?</li>
							<li class="vs">And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.</li>
							<li class="vs">And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;</li>
							<li class="vs">When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</li>
							<li class="vs">Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.</li>
							<li class="vs">And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</li>
							<li class="vs">And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.</li>
							<li class="vs">And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</li>
							<li class="vs">If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</li>
							<li class="vs">And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</li>

							<li class="vs">And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.</li>
							<li class="vs">But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.</li>
							<li class="vs">These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</li>
							<li class="vs">The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</li>

							<li class="vs">And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:</li>
							<li class="vs">Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</li>
							<li class="vs">And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.</li>

							<li class="vs">And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.</li>

							<li class="vs">And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.</li>
							<li class="vs">And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.</li>
							<li class="vs">And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.</li>
							<li class="vs">And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me?</li>

							<li class="vs">And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.</li>
							<li class="vs">And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,</li>
							<li class="vs">As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.</li>
							<li class="vs">Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.</li>
							<li class="vs">And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.</li>
							<li class="vs"> And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.</li>
							<li class="vs">And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.</li>
							<li class="vs">And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.</li>
							<li class="vs">This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.</li>
							<li class="vs">And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.</li>
							<li class="vs"> And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.</li>
							<li class="vs">He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.</li>
							<li class="vs">And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.</li>
							<li class="vs">And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.</li>
							<li class="vs">And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.</li>
							<li class="vs">Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?</li>
							<li class="vs"> And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!</li>
							<li class="vs">And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.</li>
							<li class="vs">And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.</li>
							<li class="vs">But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.</li>
							<li class="vs"> And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</li>
							<li class="vs"> And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</li>
							<li class="vs">In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.</li>
							<li class="vs">And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.</li>

							<li class="vs">And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</li>
							<li class="vs">And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</li>
							<li class="vs">And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</li>
							<li class="vs">Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</li>
							<li class="vs"> And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.</li>
							<li class="vs"> And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</li>
							<li class="vs">And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</li>
							<li class="vs">And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</li>
							<li class="vs">And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</li>
							<li class="vs">Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</li>
							<li class="vs">Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</li>
							<li class="vs">And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</li>
							<li class="vs"> Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</li>
							<li class="vs"> Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</li>
							<li class="vs">And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</li>
							<li class="vs">And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</li>
							<li class="vs">Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</li>
							<li class="vs">For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</li>
							<li class="vs">And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</li>
							<li class="vs">I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</li>
							<li class="vs">And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</li>
							<li class="vs">Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?</li>
							<li class="vs">That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</li>
							<li class="vs">And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</li>
							<li class="vs">And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:</li>
							<li class="vs"> Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.</li>
							<li class="vs">And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.</li>
							<li class="vs">And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</li>
							<li class="vs"> And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.</li>
							<li class="vs">And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.</li>
							<li class="vs">And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</li>
